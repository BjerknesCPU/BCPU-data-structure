Release tags
============

The data structure documented here for the NIRD storage location
/projects/NS9039K/data/ is version controlled using GitHub. When significant
changes are made to the data structure, the version number of the documentation
will be updated and the version will be saved as a tag in GitHub.

This allows users to go back and look at the commits for previous versions of
the documentation, by using the 'tags' tab on GitHub via a
`web browser <https://github.com/BjerknesCPU/BCPU-data-structure/tags>`_.

The version number is of the format X.Y.Z, where *X* refers to a major version
which has backward-incompatible changes, *Y* refers to a minor version with
backward-compatible functionality, and *Z* is a minor patch or bug fix. This
version is also visible at the top of the side bar of this documentation page.
